<h2 id="pomodoro"> What is the Pomodoro Technique?
</h2>

<cite>
 The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. This technique consists in using a timer to divide the work in periods of focus of 25 minutes each, with brief intervals between them. Its name comes from the Italian word “pomodoro” (tomato), as a reference to a popular tomato-shaped kitchen timer. This method is based on the idea that frequent pauses can increase mental agility. - Wikipedia
